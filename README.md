## Overview

The **Blood Donation App** is a Spring Boot-based application designed to connect blood donors and recipients in real
time. By leveraging location services, users can easily find nearby individuals with matching blood types. The app
fosters a community of voluntary and paid blood donors, ensuring a seamless and safe donation process.

To enhance safety, the app employs machine learning (ML) algorithms to assess the health suitability of donors, ensuring
they meet the required criteria. This reduces risks and ensures a smooth experience for both donors and recipients.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install **JDK 17** or later.
2. Set up a **PostgreSQL** database.
3. Install **Maven 3.8+**.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blood-donation-app
   ```
2. Configure the `application.properties` file:
   Update the file with your database credentials, Twilio API keys, and JWT secret.
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/blood_donation
   spring.datasource.username=<db_username>
   spring.datasource.password=<db_password>
   jwt.secret=<your_jwt_secret>
   twilio.account-sid=<your_twilio_account_sid>
   twilio.auth-token=<your_twilio_auth_token>
   twilio.phone-number=<your_twilio_phone_number>
   ```
3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/blood-donation-app.jar
   ```

## Machine Learning Integration

The application integrates pre-trained ML models to assess donor health based on the `Health Assessments` table. These
models predict a `health_score`, which determines donor eligibility.

### ML Features

- **Model Type**: Classification and regression.
- **Input Data**: User's health assessment records.

---

## Testing

### Unit and Integration Tests

JUnit is used to validate the application's functionality.

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
- Coverage includes:
    - Authentication (JWT Sign-In/Sign-Up).
    - Email and phone verification.
    - CRUD operations for blood requests and donations.

---

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

- Follow the installation steps above to run the application locally.

### Production Deployment

- Configure an external PostgreSQL database.
- Set up a cloud service (AWS, Azure, GCP) for hosting.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
